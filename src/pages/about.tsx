            Yes, I&apos;m yet another indian, and yes I also code. Right now,
            I&apos;m working at Deva.me and gonna be turning 16 soon. I was born
            15 years ago obviously and have had a passion or rather interest for
            technology since my childhood days. I grew up typing away on a
            computer in my spare time and today, that has led me here. I am
            proud of the journey I&apos;ve been a part of and am excited to see
            where it takes me.
            <br />
            <br />
            I had started off building tiny scripts with Python, slowly moving
            towards APIs, and to the world of frontend from there. I did think
            backend was my calling some point in time, but looking at frontend,
            it soon changed. And now, I&apos;ve had the opportunity of working
            with many amazing people on the internet.
            <br />
            <br />
            This journey, would not have been possible without several people in
            my life. From my parents, to online friends, I&apos;m grateful to
            every single one. Even the people who didn&apos;t believe in me.
            <br />
            <br />
            Other of my interests include reading, and watching TV shows or
            movies. Yeah, the latter isn&apos; exactly a hobby, but I don&apos;t
            really care. I&apos;m also a big fan of different types of music and
            songs. As a result you will often find me music status in the front
            page of this site.
            <br />

            Many are probably wondering how the image relates to me. It
            doesn&apos;t, directly. It is somewhat of what an ideal world looks
            like to me. Illustrated in my favorite comic strip style, Tintin by
            Herg√©. For the more curious ones, it&apos;s from Lexica.
